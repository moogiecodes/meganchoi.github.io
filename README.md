# Megan Choi | Personal Site 

This is my personal portfolio site incorporating: 
- HTML, CSS, Font Awesome, jQuery, and Javascript

The site has very minimal design and features:
- Landing page
- Navigation icons with fade-in tooltips upon hover
- My deployed portfolio projects (always in progress!)
- Downloadable PDF of my resume 
- Icon links to connect with me on various platforms 
- Scroll back to top button

#### Progress Notes
- Possible full refactor to React in progress
- Contemplating switching up the design completely from raw CSS to personalized Bootstrap theme

#### Deployed
